                    <p>BVRIT is located in the Greater Hyderabad region, Narsapur in close proximity to Sangareddy and IIT Hyderabad. Spanning over 110 acres of land away from the din of the city, this campus trains approximately 4500 students. It nurtures them through their path to education and enlightenment and empowers them for the challenges beyond. A lush green forest surrounds BVRIT. If you like to spend your time, there’s always something to keep you entertained – having coffee with friends, catching a film, boating, or getting involved in clubs and societies. We have a good network of buses to commute to campus from all parts of Hyderabad, Sangareddy, and Medak.
