<h1 class="tittle">Clubs and their details</h1>
<p>Clubs in a B.Tech college are crucial for holistic student development, providing a blend of technical and soft skills beyond academic learning. They enhance practical knowledge through hands-on experience in fields like coding, robotics, and electronics. Clubs also foster essential soft skills such as communication, leadership, and teamwork, which are vital for professional success.

    Networking opportunities are another significant benefit, as clubs connect students with peers who share similar interests and with industry professionals through workshops and seminars. This networking can lead to internships and job opportunities, boosting career prospects.</p>
